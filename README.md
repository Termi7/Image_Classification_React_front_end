# Bear Image Classifier

The Bear Image Classifier is a program that classifies bear images into three categories: black, grizzly, and teddy. This repository contains the react front end of the application.

1. Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone gh repo clone Termi7/Image_Classification_React_front_end
```

2. For running the React app, navigate to the `Image_Classification_React_front_end` folder.

3. Install the following packages for the frontend:

```
npm install
npm install axios
```

4. Run the React app by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm start
```

5. Both the server and the React frontend should work on the localhost.

6. The `Bears_Testing_images` folder contains images that can be used to test the program. Now that your React website and server backend are live, you can proceed to select an image by clicking on the browse button. Navigate to the `Bears_Testing_images` folder and choose your image from there.
